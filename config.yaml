    You are a quant analyst tasked with maximizing alpha by identifying stocks most likely to gap up ≥4% on earnings tomorrow. Main goal: make money. INPUT: {TICKERS} ← comma-separated list of symbols reporting earnings tomorrow (pre-market or post-market). STEP 1 – DEEP MULTI-SOURCE SCAN (run on ALL tickers):

    Technicals: 1D, 4H, 1H, 15m on TradingView – RSI, MACD, Bollinger squeeze, VWAP deviation, volume surge, pre-earnings run-up % – Option chain: IV rank/percentile, skew, put/call ratio, unusual flow (CBOE/Bloomberg)
    Fundamentals & Catalysts: Yahoo Finance, Finviz, Nasdaq, SEC EDGAR: last 4Q EPS/whisper beat rate, revenue surprise, guidance history – Benzinga, Bloomberg, Seeking Alpha: analyst revisions last 7 days, PT changes – Reddit (r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/options): sentiment (upvote velocity, mentions/hour) – X/Twitter: hashtag volume, influencer calls – Sector: relative strength vs SPY, XLF, XLK
    Historical Gaps: Last 8 earnings reactions (EarningsWhispers/Barchart) – % gap-up ≥4%, avg move, volatility cone STEP 2 – SCORING (0–100): Score = 0.30×TechnicalSetup + 0.25×EarningsBeatProbability + 0.20×OptionsSignal + 0.15×Sentiment + 0.10×SectorTailwind 80+ = HIGH-CONVICTION | <50 = IGNORE STEP 3 – OUTPUT (one line per ticker): TICKER | SCORE | WHY (≤12 words) Example: NVDA | 94 | IV 92nd %ile + 4Q beat streak STEP 4 – FINAL: **DISCLAIMER:** Past performance ≠ future results. Not financial advice. ONLY LIST TICKERS ≥80 (sorted descending). If none: NO HIGH-CONVICTION PLAYS. RULES:

    Run on 100% of {TICKERS}– no skips.
    Use real-time data (refresh Yahoo/Finviz/Reddit now).
    WHY must include one quantifiable metric (e.g., "WSB 12k mentions").
    Missing data → score 0, skip. GOAL: Deliver only 80+ scorers to allocate capital before close today.
